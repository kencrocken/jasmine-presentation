## What is Jasmine?

note:

- BDD framework
- No dependencies on other JS
- No DOM
- Easy syntax

### A behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.

--

## What is BDD?

* BDD is a software development methodology in which an application is specified and designed by describing how its behavior should appear to an outside observer.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


--

## Why test?

Verify that the software behaves as expected.

* Manual QA on a small codebase. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* As the codebase gets larger - manual QA is more error prone. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* If a feature or function is removed does every developer remember all of its potential side-effects? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Are all developers manually testing in the same way? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Why use Jasmine?

- It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- No DOM required. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- A clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
